Initial Parsing of data:
This file contains code for extraction of neighbors of mutation with window size of 7. A file will be generated that contains the extracted aatributes.

Sequence code:
On running the code, it will ask for input:
1 for protein ID
2 for protein + chain ID.

i.e.  1 as input: program will create auxiliary file for protein id and perform classification in 10 cross-validation using SVM light.

2 as input: program will create auxiliary file for protein+chain id and perform classification in 10 cross-validation using SVM light.


1 for proteinID
2 for proteinID+ chaninID
